# Fantasy-Sports-Projects

Here's a repository of projects where I utilize my data analytics and visualization skills on something fun: Fantasy Sports!

Started by creating a simple lineup optimizer for MLB Draftkings contests that spits out a lineup based off a csv file of projections. 

Expanded this to create a Flask Application with a simple interface that optimizes for NBA lineups. Check out http://maielld1.pythonanywhere.com/ ! Instructions in the NBA folder.

Plan to expand to an app that scrape projections from multiple sites and generate multiple lineups with player locking capabilities.

Also will throw in some jupyter notebooks where I visualize some data using different python tools
