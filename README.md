# Fantasy-Sports-Projects

Wanted to create a repository of projects where I utilize my data analytics and visualization skills on something fun: Fantasy Sports!

Starting with creating a simple lineup optimizer for MLB Draftkings contests that spits out a lineup based off a csv file of projections. 

Plan to expand to an app that scrape projections from multiple sites and generate multiple lineups with player locking capabilities.

Also will throw in some jupyter notebooks where I visualize some data using different python tools
